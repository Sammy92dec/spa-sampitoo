Rock, Paper, or Scissors - This game has been played for ages its fantastic that we can have it digitalised. Mostly it's played with two people but with this game, it will be Player vs Computer. How it works is  Rock always beats Scissors, Scissors always beat Paper, and Paper always beat Rock. A straightforward game in which you do not need a lot of practice. With this project, I practiced Javascript including also my HTML and CSS skills. </a>

### Future Implementations



### Accessibility

For the accessibility this was used:

- Semantic HTML.
- Alt attributes on images
- Sufficient colour contrast.

## <a id="testing"></a>Testing

### HTML

In contrast to the first project. I continuously tested the code along to with coding to make sure everything is ok.I started my coding with Replit as I had issue with Codeanywhere at the beginning. After validating HTML one error was marked.It was just a closing div and solved it just my removing it. I used  "https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea" to validate HTML.

### CSS

The CSS Validator gave me two errors. I had added a code to have a shadow to the game-area but it came wrong on the CSS validator though it was nice on the game I had to remove it. I used "https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" to validate CSS.

### Acessbility

I also used Lighthouse in Chrome to find ways to increase the accessibility of the website.
